        "description": "Damian Robert Nesta \"Jr. Gong\" Marley (born July 21, 1978 in Kingston, Jamaica) is a reggae artist who has won three Grammy awards. Damian Marley is the youngest son of reggae legend Bob Marley.\r\n\r\nDamian was two years old when his father Bob died; he is the only child born to Marley and Cindy Breakspeare, Miss World 1976. Damian's nickname Junior Gong is derived from his father's nickname of Tuff Gong. Damian has been performing since the age of 13 and released his first album in 1996, at the age of 18. He shares, along with most of his family, a full-time career in music. Unlike his brothers and sisters, however, his musical specialty is \"toasting\", a Jamaican vocal technique that is a predecessor to rapping.\r\n\r\nDamian has 3 records to date, including the highest placed reggae album in the USA billboard album charts with Welcome To Jamrock, and the highest place reggae song in the UK Top 40 with Welcome to Jamrock.\r\n\r\nLike his father before him and the rest of the Marley family, he is a Rastafarian and his music reflects the Rastafari guiding principles of love and political freedom.
